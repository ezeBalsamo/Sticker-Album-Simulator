# Sticker Album Simulator Documentation

A fan made game where you can get packs and complete your digital album.
Don't forget to exchange your repeated stickers!

## Context

This script simulates the completion of a sticker album.
The player has to enter the money that he/she is willing to spend.
Then, he/she will have to decide how many packs wants to buy, until:
- A) The album is completed
- B) He/she run out of money
- C) The remaining money is not enough to complete the album

As the album is completed, the probability of obtaining new stickers decreases.
